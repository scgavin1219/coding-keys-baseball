<h1>Stopwatch Derby</h1>
Stopwatch derby follows a similar format to a homerun derby in baseball. Players use a stopwatch and
try to stop it between 0.90 and 1.00 second. If players are able to stop the stopwatch in the correct
time interval they get a homerun; otherwise the player is out. Players get three outs to hit as many
homeruns as they can. 

 <ul><h2>How to Play</h2>
    <li>Click start to begin the stopwatch</li>
     <li>Click stop to stop the stopwatch</li>
     <li>Click next round when you are ready for the next pitch</li>
     <li>HIT BOMBS!</li>
  </ul>

<ul><h2>Time intervals</h2>
  <li> OUT < 0.90 second
  <li> OUT > 1.00 second
  <li> HOMERUN 0.90 to 1.00 second
</ul>

<h2>Canvas</h2>
The game board was created using Canvas. By utitilizing Canvas I was able to 
make animations when the player is too early, too late, and on time when
clicking the stopwatch. I was also able to make a moving crowd. In a future version of the game I would like to use
the canvas to have batters run around the bases as well.

<h2>Future Additions</h2>
In the future I would like to add a version that more closely relates to how 
baseball actually plays. In this version, there would be stopwatch results that 
result in singles, doubles, triples, and homeruns. Players score would be kept 
conventionally and I would implement multiple inning functionality.
