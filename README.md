# coding-keys-baseball
Coding key baseball is a game to help programmers learn some of the common key strokes in 
programming that they may have less experience with from conventional typing. In the game,
a pitch will come in the form of a key. Based on the difficulty level, players will have a 
certain amount of time to hit the key. For example, on medium difficulty, a player may have 
2 seconds to hit the "~" key. If they do not hit the key in 2 seconds they are out. 
Players get 3 outs and then the game is over. 

Easy Difficulty:
<br>
< 1 second => Homerun!
<br>
1 < x < 1.2 seconds => triple
<br>
1.2 < x < 1.5 seconds => double
<br>
1.5 < x < 2 seconds => single
<br>
over 2 seconds = out
<br> 

Playsers score points they do in a conventional game of baseball. After each hit, helmets 
representing players will move around the bases. If they get all the wayto home, they score. 
The game will keep track of their score and update the high score if a playeris able to score 
enough runs.
